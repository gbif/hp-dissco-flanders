The DiSSCo Flanders helpdesk aims at answering your questions related to the DiSSCo Flanders research
infrastructure within 2 working days (depending on the complexity of your inquiry). This service is implemented 
for internal and external users of the infrastructure. Do you have questions about implementation of procedures? 
Do you want to make use of the collections within the research infrastructures? Or do you want to know about the 
services our infrastructure has to offer? Please contact us through the [webform](https://meisebotanicgarden.eu.teamwork.com/p/forms/2aMyVKBtjp94D9Mzxopk).
