  title: "A new world-class Research Infrastructure"
  description: |      # required
    [DiSSCo](https://www.dissco.eu/) is a new world-class Research Infrastructure for the physical and digital curation of European natural science collections under common management and access policies. 
    To make the collections more visible and used, their data and media should become more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (**FAIR**). 
    Representing the largest ever formal agreement between natural history museums, botanical gardens, zoos and other collection-holding research institutions and universities, DiSSCo enables the transformation of a fragmented landscape into an integrated knowledge base. 
    DiSSCo Flanders will address biological, anthropological and geological collections, comprising preserved, living, tissues and molecular collections. Smaller lab and orphan collections are fully part of this proposal to guarantee their proper conservation and re-usability. 
    The whole workflow from specimen sampling in the field to their digitization and online publication will be addressed. The vision is to position European natural science collections at the centre of data-driven scientific excellence and innovation in biodiversity and environmental research, climate change, food security, health and the bioeconomy.

        The Belgian Biodiversity Platform (BBPF) is a science-policy interface body funded by the Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO) and is supported by a 
        Cooperation Agreement between the federal and concerned federated authorities. Within the field of biodiversity, it acts as a broker between policy, 
        science and practice. To fight biodiversity loss, different types of stakeholders need to work hand- in-hand, from public authorities to scientists, 
        businesses, citizens, practitioners and many more. The Platform maintains privileged relations with scientists and policymakers, but our strategic 
        partners are not restricted to these two communities. Indeed, science-policy interfacing (SPI) activities encompass broader interactions between 
        knowledge holders and people involved in governance, decision-making and biodiversity management on the ground.

        Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ) promotes accumulation of marine knowledge and data in marine research in Flanders, focusing on oceans, seas, coastal and tidal systems. The target groups for knowledge accumulation are the marine research community as well as educational institutions, the general public, policymakers and the industry (within the scope of the blue economy). 
        Among the core activities of VLIZ are Supporting networks of marine scientists and other concerned parties, as well as representing the Flemish marine research community in the international marine scientific circles. Next to these core activities, several ongoing activities at VLIZ are highly relevant to DiSSCo. 
        VLIZ as a member of the LifeWatch ESFRI is both the regional contributor with activities related to the observatories and data archaeology, and responsible for the development of the Species Information Backbone. Besides taxonomic information, this backbone provides access to a range of additional information, including species traits, specimen information, distributions, and habitats, linking and providing direct access to literature and to databases such as GBIF, COL, GenBank, BHL, EOL and BoLD. 
        All activities within the LifeWatch Species Information Backbone are offered as in-kind contributions to DiSSCo: interlinking such data with collection data will broaden the research applications and potential of the collections within DiSSCo. VLIZ will contribute to DiSSCo with a marine core repository collection. This repository contains marine sediment sample collections of great importance in ocean research. They are used for research in climate, environment, many other marine geological studies, and for education.

        Botanic Gardens and Arboreta Association (VBTA) is a Belgian association with legal status in Flanders (seat in MeiseBG).
        On board are the largest botanic gardens of Belgium, as well as several smaller arboreta. From the 21 gardens listed, 19 are situated in Flanders. In total, it is estimated that they harbor more than 30K different species of plants.
        Based on the information available for the gardens not listed above as part of the other consortium members, up to 25K herbarium specimens are present. The living collections are expressed in different metrics: number of individual plants (especially when counting trees), number of taxa or number of accessions. In the early 2000 a federal project called PlantCol, coordinated by MeiseBG, set the first steps to federate these valuable living botanic collections in Belgium under one portal. DiSSCo is the occasion to update this portal to modern standards and mobilize the data using standard metrics.
