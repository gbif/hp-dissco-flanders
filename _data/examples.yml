  title: "A new world-class Research Infrastructure"
  description: |      # required
    [DiSSCo](https://www.dissco.eu/) is a new world-class Research Infrastructure for the physical and digital curation of European natural science collections under common management and access policies. 
    To make the collections more visible and used, their data and media should become more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (**FAIR**). 
    Representing the largest ever formal agreement between natural history museums, botanical gardens, zoos and other collection-holding research institutions and universities, DiSSCo enables the transformation of a fragmented landscape into an integrated knowledge base. 
    DiSSCo Flanders will address biological, anthropological and geological collections, comprising preserved, living, tissues and molecular collections. Smaller lab and orphan collections are fully part of this proposal to guarantee their proper conservation and re-usability. 
    The whole workflow from specimen sampling in the field to their digitization and online publication will be addressed. The vision is to position European natural science collections at the centre of data-driven scientific excellence and innovation in biodiversity and environmental research, climate change, food security, health and the bioeconomy.

  title: "Citizen Science Project - Transcribing digital data"
  description: |
    **Data Digitization:** DoeDat is primarily concerned with capturing data from physical collections and converting it into digital formats. This digitization process is crucial for researchers as it allows them to access and analyze the data more effectively. Digitized data can be used for various studies and purposes, including biodiversity research and cultural heritage preservation.

    **Participation:** DoeDat is a citizen science project that engages volunteers in the transcription of herbarium and specimen labels into digital formats. The projects within DoeDat focus on transcribing images associated with various institutions and organizations. Some of these projects include Stad Brugge, het FotoMuseum van Antwerpen, provincie Antwerpen, Natuurhistorisch Museum Luxemburg, CAVA, rozenverenigingen Piaget, Rosa Belgica, World Federation of Rose Societies, Royal Museum for Central Africa, Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, and KOERS Museum of Cycle Racing.

    **Data Accessibility:** Once data is digitized, it becomes accessible to the scientific and broader communities. Various mechanisms are used to make this data available, including websites like the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](https://www.gbif.org/), [Botanical Collections](https://www.botanicalcollections.be/#/en/home), [europeana.eu](https://www.europeana.eu/en), and [Plants.jstor](https://plants.jstor.org/).
