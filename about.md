Natural science collections contain a huge amount of information on the past and present of biodiversity worldwide. Since digitization at the specimen level is
far from being accomplished to date, it remains a challenge to find relevant specimens and valorize the importance of these collections. Especially the smaller
collections often remain unknown and even risk neglect or even disappearance. The Latimer Core standard wants to provide an answer to make collections and
collection data more discoverable and interoperable.

The DiSSCo Flanders use-case looked at the content of regional Flemish collections through a survey. The smaller research collections and living plant
collections typically had only limited or no online representation of their content. Even a rough inventory of many collections was lacking. The standardized
approach of conducting the survey made sure that the content of the collections can be compared to each other. This also made it possible to have a graphical
representation of the collections through a PowerBI dashboard, which is instrumental in increasing the visibility of the collections for scientists and policy
makers.
